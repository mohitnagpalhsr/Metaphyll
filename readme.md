# Working on it

Metaphyll is a basic Login and SignUp web app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the frontend and NodeJs as the backend, which will automatically save the user's Login/Sign Up credentials on the client side in case the connection is lost and then automatically logs in/signs up the user when the connection is back without the need to click on Login/Sign Up button.
